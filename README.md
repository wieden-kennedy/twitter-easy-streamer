# Twitter Easy Streamer

Streaming from Twitter using tweepy is pretty easy, but you still need to write a lot of the glue code you'd inevitably need to use the status messages you find in your app.

This is a rule-based listener that Grant and I knocked together for a quick Nike thing.

It lives here now, as it's own library - with some additions to make it even easier to use.
